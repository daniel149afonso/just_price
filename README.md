# 🎯 Just Price — JavaScript Project

**Just Price** is a small interactive JavaScript project where the user has to guess the correct price (like the game show “The Price is Right”).  
The goal: find the exact number in as few tries as possible!

## 🕹️ How it works

- A random number (the “just price”) is generated between 1 and 1000 .
- The user enters a guess in an input field.
- The program responds with:
  - 🔼 “It’s higher” if the guess is too low
  - 🔽 “It’s lower” if the guess is too high
  - ✅ “Congratulations!” if it’s correct
- The game counts the number of attempts.
